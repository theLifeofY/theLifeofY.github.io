								<h3>Wedding Red Envelopes</h3>
								<p>First off, we are so thankful that you could join us to celebrate our wedding, and any additional gift on top of your presence is <u>not</u> necessary. 
									However, should you wish to contribute to our future home and travel funds, we would love for you to use the
									<u><b>red wedding envelope</b></u> that you have received along with your invitation.</p>
								
								<p>Your <u><b>red wedding envelope</b></u> follows the Chinese and Korean gifting traditions of "hongbao," "chug ui-geum," or "lucky money." 
									This money is provided to newlyweds on the day of their wedding to bless the start of their married life together. 
									Additionally, we ask everyone, regardless of a monetary gift, to <u>please bring your <b>red envelope</b> filled with the gift of <b>a word of 
									encouragement or a word of advice</b> that you have for us as we begin this next chapter of our lives together.</u></p>
									
									<p>Because we anticipate a move in the near future as we continue to establish our careers and a more permanent home together, 
									<u>we kindly request that no physical items be gifted to us during this time.</u>	</p>

					<!--		<p>Below are some resources to read about the tradition. </p>
								<ul>
									<li> Where to buy Chinese and Korean wedding gift envelopes. You will most likely find them at your local Chinese or Korean market, or you can order them on Etsy.</li>
									<li> The significance of lucky money </li>
								</ul> -->

								<hr />

								<h4>Online Cash Registry</h4>
								<p>If you would like to contribute to our future home and travel funds electronically, 
									you can also send a gift through Venmo at <b>@Sydney-Arndorfer</b> or Paypal at <b>sydneyarndorfer@gmail.com</b>. 

									<p>Because we anticipate a move in the near future as we continue to establish our careers and a more permanent home together, 
									<u>we kindly request that no physical items be gifted to us during this time.</u>	</p>

									
		<!--	In addition, your contribution to our online cash registry will support future goals, like our honeymoon, and a portion of our funds will go towards two organizations we support. </ b> 
								We have provided the name and short blurb about each organization if you'd like to learn why support them and their work. </p>
